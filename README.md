# FutureHorizons_Capstone_TVShowTracker
This project provides an interactive console interface for multiple users to sign in and track their planned, in-progress, and completed TV shows. User and Show data will be stored in an SQL database and interfaced with the console app through JDBC so that users can view their show information, as well as set/update and track their progress.
